# Google Spreadsheet to Map

This is a minimal demo to map data managed in a google spreadsheet on an interactive map to be embedded on a website.

You can see it live at https://arska.github.io/spreadsheet2map/

The data is managed in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M1fLxts5Ubgdh1vMsqvtCoa3qziyF4hjXsY_yTZxsss/edit#gid=0 and exported using the "publish to web" google spreadsheet feature that exports it as CSV
